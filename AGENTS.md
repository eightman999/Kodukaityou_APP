# AI Agents

This file contains general information about AI agents.

## Project Overview

This project, named 'kodukaityou', appears to be an iOS application developed using Swift and Xcode. It integrates various third-party libraries via CocoaPods, including Firebase for backend services (Authentication, Database, Firestore, Storage), Charts for data visualization, and other UI/utility libraries like IQKeyboardManager, SDWebImage, SVProgressHUD, and RealmSwift. The application seems to handle user input, display data, and potentially manage some form of financial or budget-related information, given file names like `InmoneyViewController.swift` and `SavebudgetViewController.swift`.

# External Agent Policy

This repository uses multiple coding agents.

## Agy / Antigravity CLI

Default role:
- read-only audit
- requirements checking
- documentation consistency
- long-context scan
- log and diff compression

Default prompt:

```text
Read the mission, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, README, and relevant docs.
Do not edit files.
Return:
1. conclusion
2. hidden assumptions
3. contradictions
4. affected files
5. risks
6. recommended next action
```

Rules:
- Agy is NOT a primary implementation worker.
- If Agy must implement something, isolate it in a separate branch/worktree first.

## OpenCode(GLM)

Default role:
- secondary implementation lane
- independent patch attempt
- scoped feature work
- tests and refactors

Rules:
- Prefer separate git worktree
- Keep changes minimal
- Do not redesign unrelated systems
- Do not use `/share` (never share private repository content publicly)
- Return changed files, tests run, risks, and unresolved questions

Suggested worktree flow:

```bash
git worktree add ../PROJECT-glm -b glm/TASK_NAME
cd ../PROJECT-glm
opencode
```

## Codex

Default role:
- peer senior engineer
- rescue
- adversarial review
- independent second opinion

Use cases:
- hard bug
- design challenge
- security-sensitive review
- Claude loop recovery
- final review before risky merge

Rules:
- Do not enable an always-on review gate by default.
- Use Codex on high-risk decisions only when the extra cost is justified.

## Required final report (all external agents)

1. conclusion / approach summary
2. changed files (if any)
3. tests run and their actual output
4. risks
5. unresolved questions
